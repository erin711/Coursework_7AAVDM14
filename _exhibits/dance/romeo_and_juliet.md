act-brief: |
  Count Paris talks to Capulet about marrying his daughter Juliet, but Capulet asks Paris to wait two years and invites him to the planned Capulet ball. Lady Capulet and Juliet's nurse try to persuade Juliet to accept Paris' courtship.    

  Romeo meets and falls in love with Juliet at the Capulet party. Juliet's cousin Tybalt, enraged by Romeo's sneaking into the ball, is only prevented from killing Romeo by Juliet's father, who does not want to bleed in his house. After the dance, Romeo introduced her to him and they agreed to marry. With the help of Friar Lawrence, they hoped to reconcile the two families through the children's union, and the next day they were secretly married...
