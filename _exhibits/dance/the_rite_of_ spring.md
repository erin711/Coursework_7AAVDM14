synopsis: "The work is unified by a single idea: Spring, which has no specific plot or narrative and should be seen as a series of carefully choreographed episodes"     
act-brief: |
  _**Act I**_ - Spring celebrations begin in the mountains. An old woman came in and began to predict the future. Young girls came from the river, in a single line. They started the kidnapping dance, and the young girls were doing the Khorovod, the spring round dance. People split into two opposing groups and began "rival tribal rituals". A sacred procession led by wise elders enters, and under the guidance of the sage, the game is suspended and the earth is blessed. People danced a passionate dance, sanctified and united with the earth.      
  _**Act II**_ - The young girls played mysterious games and walked in circles. One of the young girls was Chosen by fate, caught twice in the eternal circle, and revered as "Chosen One" with the military dance. In a brief dance, the young girls awaken the ancestors. The chosen one was entrusted to the care of an elderly wise man. In the great "sacrificial dance," the chosen son dances to his death before the old man.
