act-brief: |
  **Act I**_ - At Doris's castle, the celebration of the young Countess Ramonda's name day is underway. Her aunt, Countess Sibylly, chided those present for their laziness and enthusiasm for dancing, told them about the legendary White Lady, every time a member was in danger, and punished those who did not perform their duties. The young man laughed at the countess's superstition and continued to celebrate. Raymond's fiance sends the noble crusader with a letter to his fiance. Suddenly, the celebrations are interrupted when the seneschal announces that an uninvited Saracen knight, Abderakhman, and his entourage have arrived at the castle, where they have sought refuge for the night. The party continued late into the night, and Ramonda fell asleep alone on the couch. As she slept, she began to dream of lady White appearing in the moonlight.    

  The whole garden was shrouded in mist, and after a while the mist disappeared, and Jean de Brienne appeared. Ramonda was overjoyed and rushed to his arms, surrounded by glory and knights and fairies. Abdurakman professes his love for her, but Ramonda, though confused and upset, quickly rejects him. Imps and elves appeared around Ramonda from all sides, and Ramonda gave a loud cry and fell to the ground in a faint. The terrible vision disappeared with the White Lady.
  
  **Act II**_ -  A banquet is being held in honor of the arrival of Jean de Brienne. Ramonda welcomes her guest, but cannot hide the delay caused by her unease to let De Brienne. Abderakhman repeatedly approaches her and reveals his passion for her, but remembering the White Lady's warning, Ramonda disdainfully rejects him. Abderakhman becomes more insistent and realizes that the only way to have Raymonda is to use force. Jean de Brienne rescues Raymond from the Saracens and tries to capture Abderakhman. The king ordered the two rivals to end the affair in a duel, and Abderakhman fell unconscious and was killed by Jean de Brienne's sword. Raymonda happily embraces her fiance, and the two confirm their love again, with the king holding their hands.    
  
  **Act III**_ - Raymonda and Jean de Brienne were eventually married, and King Andrew II of Hungary gave the newlyweds his blessing. In his honor, everyone at the court dressed in Hungarian fashion and performed a series of Hungarian-style dances, culminating in a cavalier tournament.

  Today, Ramonda is performed by many ballet companies around the world, with choreography largely derived from Konstantin Sergeyev's revival of the Kirov Ballet in 1948 (wikipedia, 2021).
