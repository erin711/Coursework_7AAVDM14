synopsis: "This ghostly ballet tells the tragic and romantic story of a beautiful young peasant girl drawn 
to the flirtations of the deceitful and camouflaged aristocrat Albrecht. When the ruse is revealed, the vulnerable Giselle dies of a broken heart, and Albrecht must face the otherworldly consequences of his careless seduction."
act-brief: |
  _**Act I**_ - A young nobleman, though engaged, falls in love with Giselle, a shy and beautiful peasant girl. Albrecht disguises himself as a humble villager named "Lois" to curry favor with the charming and innocent Giselle, who has no idea of his true identity. With the help of his squire, Albrecht hides his elaborate costume, hunting horns, and sword, and then coaxes Giselle out of the house to fall in love with her at the start of the harvest celebrations.    
  _**Act II**_  - They were the spirits of girls who died after being betrayed by their lovers and took revenge on men by exhausting them by dancing at night (a popular theme in ballet in the romantic era). Led by Queen Milsa of Willis, they summon Gisele from her grave and target her lover, killing her, but Gisele's great love frees him from their grasp.
