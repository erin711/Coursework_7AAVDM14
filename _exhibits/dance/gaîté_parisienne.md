act-brief: |
  _**Act I**_ - Four waiters and four cleaning ladies are preparing the room for the evening's entertainment. The first to arrive was a pretty flower girl who had come to sell bouquets to customers. Next came half a dozen chattering little prostitutes, who danced a rousing mazurka around the room. At the end of the film, an attractive glove-seller appears at the door and breezes into the room, captivating everyone present. When the music changes, a wealthy Peruvian tourist arrives and walks in happily. Armed with two bags, he was so eager to join the Paris nightlife that he didn't stop to store his luggage. Then, to the rhythm of a waltz, a handsome baron entered. He was welcomed by the flower girl, but he was immediately smitten by the glove seller. Then drums and marches signal the arrival of an officer and a platoon of soldiers. Suddenly, a fashionable social belle, a prostitute called La Lionne, arrived, accompanied by her, a duke, and a companion, a lady in green. The room was now full of people looking for an evening of recreation, entertainment and perhaps erotic adventure.  

  Lionne was the centre of attention in a bright red ball gown. She competes for the attention of the officer, who flirts with the glove seller, who tries to make the baron jealous by pretending to respond to the Peruvian's attention. An argument broke out between the four men and a fight broke out. At the climax of the merriment that followed, everyone joined in a cacophony of voices.  

  After that, the mood eased; The lights dimmed, and as a soft barcarolle played, everyone prepared to leave. Some guests left in pairs. La Lyon left with the officer, the flower girl left with the Duke, and the others drifted slowly out into the night. The Peruvian returns, expecting to find a glove seller waiting for him. Instead, he found her in a warm embrace with the baron.

  Rosenthal was reportedly initially reluctant to complete the choreography, saying:"I don't know Offenbach very well; I'm not used to arranging other people's music; I don't want to do this; I don't know Massine." Desormiere's persistence, however, was enough for Rosenthal to finally accept the assignment(wikipedia, 2021).
