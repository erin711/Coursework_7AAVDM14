act-brief: |
  _**Act I**_ - The Stahlbaum Home and a Pine Forest     
  The party has begun. Drosselmeyer enters the room, a local councillor, magician, and Clara's godfather. He was also a talented toymaker who brought presents to children. Clara and her brother are sad to see the doll taken away, but Drosemerel has another toy for them: a wooden nutcracker carved in the shape of a little man, which Clara takes an instant liking to, but Fritz accidentally breaks it. But Drosselmeyer fixed the nutcracker. In the evening, when Clara reached her little bed, suddenly the room was full of mice and the Christmas tree began to grow to dizzying heights. Nutcrackers can also grow to life size. Clara finds herself in a battle between a gingerbread soldier and a rat, led by their king. The mice began to eat the gingerbread soldiers. The mice retreat, and the Nutcracker becomes a handsome prince who takes Clara through the moonlit night to a pine forest where snowflakes fly around them, and at the end of the first act, he calls them to his kingdom.     
  
  _**Act II**_ - The Land of Sweets          
  Clara and the prince came to the beautiful candy land. He told her how he had been saved from the Rat King by Clara and turned back into himself. In honor of the young heroine, they made a celebration of candy from all over the world, and everyone danced for entertainment; The Danish shepherdesses played their flutes; A string of beautiful flowers played a waltz. To end the evening, the sugar plum fairy and her knight performed a dance. The final waltz is performed by all the candies, after which the sugar plum Fairy greets Clara and the Prince down from their thrones. He bowed to her, and she kissed Clara good-bye and led them to the sleigh pulled by the reindeer. When they waved goodbye to all the subjects who returned their hands, the plane took off.
