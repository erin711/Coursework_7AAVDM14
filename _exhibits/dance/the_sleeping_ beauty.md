synopsis:" Each has a theme that represents them throughout the ballet and serves as an important clue to the underlying plot. The third act of the work, however, disengages entirely from these two themes, focusing instead on the individuality of the various court dances."
act-brief: |
  _**Prologue**_ - King Florestan XXIV and his queen welcomed their first child, Princess Aurora, and announced a grand christening in her honor. Six fairies were invited to the ceremony to present gifts to the child. The evil fairy Carabosse arrives with the Lilac fairy. Carabosse angrily asked the king and Queen why she had not been invited to the baptism. Carabosse curses the little princess as revenge: Aurora on her 16th birthday, she will stab her finger on the spindle and die. However, the lilac fairy stepped in. Although she did not have the power to lift the curse completely, she changed it, allowing the spindle to put the princess to sleep for 100 years instead of death.     
  
  _**Act I**_ - As the celebrations got underway, the Queen gently persuaded the king to spare innocent citizens, and he agreed. After an elaborate waltz, Princess Aurora enters. Aurora and the suitors performed the famous Rose adagio. Now a stranger in a cloak appeared and offered the princess a present: a spindle. Never seen before, Aurora examines the strange object curiously and pricks her finger. The caped stranger revealed himself to be Carabosse. Once again, the lilac fairy silences the noise and reminds the King and Queen that Aurora is only asleep.    
  
  _**Act II**_ - A hundred years later, Prince Desiret attended a hunting party. Alone in the forest, he meets the lilac fairy, who chooses him to wake Aurora. She showed him a vision of the beautiful princess, and the prince was immediately smitten. Carabosse makes one last attempt to cement her revenge curse, but the Lilac Fairy and the Prince eventually manage to defeat her together. Once inside the castle, Desiree wakes Aurora up with a kiss.    
  
  _**Act III**_  - The royal wedding is underway. Guests include gem fairies, lilac fairies and fairy tale characters. Aurora and Desire performed a grand pas de deux and a full ensemble dance. The prince and princess were married, and the lilac fairy blessed their union.
