synopsis: "Le Spectre de la rose is a short ballet about a young girl who dreams of dancing with the spirit of the rose at the first ball"   
act-brief: |
  The curtain rises on a girl's bedroom. The young girl came into the room in a white hat and ball gown. After the first dance, she went home. She was holding a rose as a memento of the evening. She sank back into a chair and fell asleep. The rose dropped from her fingertips to the floor. You can see the spirit of the rose outside. He walked to the floor and approached the little girl. Still asleep, she got up and danced with him. He led her back to the chair, kissed her, and dived out of the window into the night. The young girl woke up. She picked up the fallen rose and kissed it. The curtain falls.
