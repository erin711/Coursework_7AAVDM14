synopsis: |
  Pulcinella is drawn from Naples’s manuscripts dating back to 1700, which contain many comedies depicting traditional roles in the popular Neapolitan stage. The play comes from Quatre Polichinelles semblables.    
act-brief: |
  _**Act I**_ - The story begins with Florindo and Cloviello serenading Prudenza and Rosetta. Unfazed, the two women responded by splashing water on their suitors. Prudenza's father, a doctor, showed up and drove them away. The ballet ends with three marriages.
