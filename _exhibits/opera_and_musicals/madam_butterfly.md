act-brief: |
  _1904, in Nagasaki, Japan._  
  _**Act I**_ - Cio-Cio-san (from the Japanese word for "butterfly") got married with a U.S. naval officer named Pinkerto, but he intends to leave her once he finds a proper American wife.  

  **Act II** - Three years later, Butterfly is still waiting for Pinkerton to return, as he had left shortly after their wedding. Her maid Suzuki keeps trying to convince her that he is not coming back. Butterfly gave birth to Pinkerton's son after he had left and asks Sharpless to tell him.  

  **Act III** - Sharpless and Pinkerton arrive at the house, along with Pinkerton's new American wife, Kate. Butterfly cannot handle the truth and kills herself with her father's seppuku knife.

transition: This opera has an indoor lyrical style. It does not pursue complex plots and external stage effects, but does its best to portray the psychological activities of the heroine Cio-Cio-san. Although the premiere of such a great opera ended in a disastrous defeat, Puccini made a major deletion of "Madame Butterfly", and in May 1904, it won the second performance unexpected success in Brescia, Italy. Since then, Puccini's musical has become one of the most popular repertoires on the world opera stage. Let's go back to this sad love story of Madam Butterfly in 1870...
