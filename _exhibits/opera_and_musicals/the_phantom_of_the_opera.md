synopsis: "In an opera house in Paris, strange things happened frequently--the original lead heroine was almost killed, and a creepy phantom male voice appeared in the theater. This voice comes from the \"ghost\" who lives in the underground labyrinth of the theater. He fell in love with actress Christine, taught her to sing secretly, and helped her get the position of the heroine, but Christine loved the theater patron Lau Er, this caused a series of plots such as jealousy, chasing, and murder. In the end, the \"ghost\" realized that his love for Christine had surpassed personal possessiveness, so he freed Christine, leaving behind his cloak and mask, and disappearing into the dark underground maze alone."
act-brief: |
  _**Prologue**_ - The story begins in 1919, when the aged Vicomte Raoul de Chagny is participating in an auction at the Paris Opera. One item is the Chandelier, which fell to pieces in the famous Phantom Incident. The auctioneer turned on the newly installed electric lights on the chandelier so that everyone could see the restored chandelier.  
  
  <strong><i>Act I</i></strong> - Go back 49 years ago, on the stage of the Paris Opera. Christine sang instead of Carlotta because of the rumor of the Phantom of the Opera. The Phantom uses singing to lure Christine to the house in the heart of the underground lake where he lives. Here, he continues to use Music of the Night to seduce Christine's mind and express his love. Christine took off the mask of the phantom, but the Phantom cursed Christine that won't let her free, but then told her that fear would eventually turn into love. Everyone started a plan to thwart the Phantom. At the close, the big chandelier of the theater fell...  

  _**Act II**_ - About 6 months after the chandelier fell. Phantom stated in this final instruction that all his requirements must be met, otherwise, greater disaster will be waiting for them. Suddenly the piano played a rehearsal without anyone playing. Christine was frightened and went to his father's cemetery for help. The phantom appeared in front of her again. The Phantom told her that he was the Angel of Music that his father said, and he was here to guide and protect her. At this time, Raoul obstructed the Phantom, making the Phantom very angry, and vowed to retaliate against the two of them.   
  
  Returned to the theater, Raoul decided to break the boat and fight the Phantom for the last time. At this time, Christine's feelings for the Phantom had changed from sympathy to hatred, without the slightest love. The Phantom gave Christine a choice of her live. Then, she gave the Phantom a long kiss...   
  
  This kiss, like the brilliance of the Creator in the sky, illuminates the closed heart of the Phantom. On the throne of the Phantom, only one mask was left. In 1919, there was a rose tied with a black ribbon on the tomb of the deceased Christina.
