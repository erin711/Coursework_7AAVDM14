transition: "The Valkyrie is the second part of Wagner’s four-opera Ring saga. These four musicals are masterpieces completed by Wagner in more than two decades. The scripts of the series are written by Wagner himself based on Nordic myths and legends, and the plot is tragic as a whole. \"The Ring Series\" is also a model of Wagner's musical reform. The first Munich performances of Die Walküre were generally hailed as successes by audiences and critics. Let's go back to this first performance of Wagner’s Die Walküre..."
