Willie's attitude of dedication and friendship was once known throughout New England, often driving for long periods of time to sell. Willie had worked hard for half his life and was due to retire and enjoy a life of material abundance, but after a series of mental symptoms, he lost his clients and jobs, and the lives of his two sons were not satisfactory. Willie's long-held expectations are not met, and he gradually becomes disappointed in life and eventually dies."
