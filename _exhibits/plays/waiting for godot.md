synopsis: 
  "'Waiting for Godot' is a tragedy of 'nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes'. The work focuses on the expression of people's state of mind, the process of psychological activities and psychological activities of people's obstacles. The characters in the works have no distinct personalities, and the works have no coherent plot. Waiting for Godot was a real innovation in theater history and the first successfully performed play of the absurd." 
act-brief: |

  _**Act I**_  
  Vladimir and Estragon, two men, met next to a leafless tree, they discussed a lot of questions, and they were waiting for a man named Godot, but they weren't sure if they had seen Godot or not, or even if Godot would arrive.  
  Pozzo and his slave Lucky then arrive at the place, where Pozzo says he is on his way to the market, intending to sell Lucky. At this point Lucky performs a dance and a monologue that mysteriously references the basic themes of the play, after which Pozzo and Lucky leave.
  Soon, a boy appeared and told Vladimir and Estragon that he was Godot's messenger and that Godot would not arrive until tomorrow, so they decided to leave.  

  _**Act II**_  
  The next day, the tree grew many leaves, and Vladimir and Estragon were still waiting for Godot. Lucky and Pozzo reappeared, but Lucky became mute and Pozzo went blind, but Pozzo did not remember seeing Vladimir and Estragon, and soon after Pozzo and Lucky left. It wasn't long before the boy reappeared, telling them that Godot wouldn't come back, and he told them that he wasn't the boy from yesterday, and they became even more depressed. Vladimir and Estragon thought about committing suicide, but gave up because there was no rope.They decide to leave and return the day after with a rope, but again they remain as the curtain falls on the final act.
