synopsis: "When Prince Hamlet of Denmark was studying at the schooling of Wittenberg in Germany, he suddenly received news of his father's death. When he returned to attend his father's funeral, he encountered a series of events, his uncle Claudius ascending the throne, and his uncle and his mother Gertrude rushing to marry a month after his father's funeral, which filled Hamlet with suspicion and dissatisfaction. The ghost of his father Hamlet then appears, explaining that he was poisoned by Claudius and demanding revenge on Hamlet. Hamlet then pretends to be crazy to cover himself up and confirms that his uncle is indeed his father-killer. Claudius attempts to get rid of Hamlet by the hand of the king, but Hamlet flees back to Denmark, only to learn that Ophelia has committed suicide and has to accept a duel with her brother Laertes. During the duel, Hamlet's mother, Gertrude, was poisoned by drinking the poisonous wine that Claudius had prepared for Hamlet. Hamlet and Laertes were also poisoned by the sword. Hamlet, who knew the cause of the poisoning, killed Claudius and asked his friend to tell his story to his descendants.

act-brief: |

  _**Act I**_  
  The protagonist of "Hamlet" is Hamlet, the son of King Hamlet who has just passed away. Claudius is his uncle. In order to seize the throne, he took Hamlet's mother Gertrud. Denmark and Norway have long-term grievances. Although Norway is currently under the control of the frail and sickly brother of King Fortinbras, Denmark is worried about the invasion led by the dead Norwegian King's son,Prince Fortinbras.  
  One night, the ghost of King Hamlet appeared on the ramparts of Elsinore, the Danish royal castle, and it was seen by Sentry Bernardo, Marcellus, and Prince Hamletâ€™s friend Horatio, and they decided to tell Hamlet.  
  At the court meeting the next day, Hamlet watched gloomily as King Claudius and Queen Gertrude discussed state affairs with Polonius, the counselor. Claudius allowed Polonius' son Laerstes to return to school in France and forbade Hamlet from returning to wittenberg School. After leaving the court, Hamlet learned about the ghost from Horatio and decided to see it for himself.
  While Laerstes warns his sister Ophelia not to seek Hamlet's attention when she confesses her interest in him, Polonius orders her to reject his offer. When Hamlet went to find out the truth of the ghost, the ghost appeared to Hamlet on the wall and told him that he had been murdered by Claudius, and asked Hamlet to avenge him. So Hamlet decided to pretend to be mad to achieve his revenge plan.  
  _**Act II**_  
  Ophelia then rushed to her father and told him that Hamlet had come to her door half naked the night before and acted strange. Polonius believes that Hamlet's anomalies are caused by love, and he decides to inform Claudius and Gertrude about it. When he got there, he saw that the king and queen were greeting Rosenkrantz and Gilden Stern, two of Hamlet's two pupils, and they both knew Hamlet. The king and queen explained their purpose in the hope that the students would investigate the cause of Hamlet's abnormal behavior.  
  Polonius told Claudius and Gertrude about the cause of Hamlet's abnormal behavior, and talked to Hamlet in the halls of the castle, through which they wanted to know more about the matter. Hamlet pretends to be crazy and keeps insulting Polonius in disguise. When Rosenkrantz and Gilden Stern arrived, Hamlet greeted his "friends" warmly, when in fact Hamlet knew they had also come to inquire about the news. Hamlet merely admits that he is uncomfortable with his current situation, but he doesn't say why. Rosenkrantz and Gilden Stern told Hamlet that they had brought in a group of actors whom they had met on their way to Elsino. Hamlet welcomed the actors and confessed that he had discovered his friend had become a spy, but he asked for a monologue about the deaths of King Priam and Queen Hekuba at the height of the Trojan War. They were impressed by the speech he gave, who conspired to stage The Murder of Gonzago, a play that featured his father's murder style and determined the veracity of the ghost story, and they also wanted to study Claudius's reaction to determine whether he had committed a crime.  
  _**Act III**_  
  To test whether Hamlet is really mad, Polonius forces Ophelia to return Hamlet's love letters and symbols of affection to the prince, and evaluates Hamlet's reaction with Claudius. When Ophelia tries to return Hamlet's things, he accuses her of immodesty and shouts, and his reaction convinces Claudius that he is not angry for love.    
  Soon, when the court has gathered to see a play commissioned by Hamlet, Claudius suddenly gets up and leaves at the sight of the poisoned scene. This reaction is proof to Hamlet of his uncle's guilt.  
  On his way to his mother's room, Hamlet meets Claudius, who falls to his knees, and he says to himself that he cannot repent, because he still has this ill-gotten fortune:his brother's crown and wife. Hamlet sneaked behind him but didn't kill him. In the Queen's bedroom, Hamlet had a big fight with his mother. Polonius hid to the side to spy, and Gertrude thought Hamlet was going to kill her, so he cried out for help, and in a panic Hamlet mistakenly killed Polonius. In anger he insulted his mother. The ghost enters and reprimands Hamlet, but Gertrude is unable to see or hear the ghost, thinking hamlet is going further mad. After pleading with the queen not to sleep with Claudius again, Hamlet dragged Polonius's body away.    
  _**Act IV**_  
  Upon learning of Polonius' death, Claudius feared for his life and wrote a secret letter to the king asking Hamlet to be executed. Ophelia is saddened by her father's death, and Lylester returns from France, outraged by the news of her father's death and her sister's madness. Claudius proposes that Lecters engage in a fencing match with Hamlet in an attempt to poison Hamlet. Gertrude interrupted him, saying that Ophelia had drowned and the cause of death was unknown.     
  _**Act V**_  
  Horatio receives a letter from Hamlet in which the prince escaped while negotiating with the pirates. They were talking to the gravediggers, and Ophelia's funeral procession came, organized by Laertes. Hamlet and Horatio initially hide, but when Hamlet finds the buried person Ophelia, he takes the initiative to stand up and he announces his love for her in public.    
  Back in Elsino, Hamlet explains to Horatio that he has found claudius with rosenkrantz and Gilden stern's relics, which contain a letter that he feels his former friend should have been killed. Their conversation was interrupted by Osric, who even challenged Hamlet with fencing. Hamlet accepted the courtier's challenge despite Horatio's persuasion. Hamlet initially prevailed, and Gertrude raised a glass to him with the poisonous wine glass that Claudius had left for Hamlet. Claudius tried to stop her, but it was too late, she had already drunk the poisoned wine, and Laertes realized that the plot would be exposed. Lelters slashed Hamlet with his poisonous sword. In the melee that followed, they exchanged swords in their hands, and Hamlet stabbed Laertes with his own poisonous sword. Gertrude fell and died. In his dying moments, Lelters reconciles with Hamlet and exposes Claudius' ruse. Hamlet rushed toward Claudius and killed him. As the poison slowly took effect, Hamlet heard that Fortinbras was marching in the area and appointed the Norwegian prince as his next successor. Horatio felt sad at the thought that he had survived and Hamlet had died. He said he would commit suicide, but Hamlet pleaded with him to continue living and tell his story to posterity.     
  Hamlet died in Horatio's arms and said "all that's left is silence". Fortinbras marched to Poland with his army, and he came to the palace, where a British ambassador brought news of the deaths of Rosenkrantz and Gilden stern. Horatio promised to tell the whole story of these events, and When Fortinbras saw that the entire Danish royal family was dead, he spontaneously became king and ordered a solemn funeral in memory of Hamlet.

  There is insufficient conclusive evidence for specific performances in the early days of the play. It is sometimes thought that the crew of the Red Dragon, moored near Sierra Leone, performed Hamlet in September 1607; However, this claim is based on the insertion of a "lost" paragraph in a period document in the 19th century and is widely regarded today as a hoax . More believable, the play toured Germany for five years after Shakespeare's death. It was performed before James I in 1619 and Charles I in 1637. Oxford editor George Shepard argues that because there are many innuendos and references to Hamlet in contemporary literature (Shakespeare only mentions Falstaff), the frequency of the play's performances is certainly not recorded in history.    
  What is certain is that the famous "Hamlet" was later put on the silver screen many times and adapted into multiple versions of the stage play, which was deeply loved by the audience.
  There are many recorded performances of Hamlet, but the first one is far from perfect and famous, so let's review one of the more famous performances (wikipedia 2021)
