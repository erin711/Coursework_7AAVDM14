synopsis: "Set on an August day in 1912, the play depicts a family in Seaside Connecticut struggling to cope with the reality and consequences of failure involving other family members. The parents in the story are full of resentment, blame and blame towards their children, but despite their disillusionment with life, they end up making self-defeating attempts at affection and encouragement.

transition: "Although O 'Neill did not wish the play to be produced as a play, or even published in his lifetime, Monterey published the play by Yale University Press in 1956. The Swedish people were far more receptive to O 'Neill's work than any other country, and as a result, the play was shown in Swedish in Stockholm on February 2, 1956, to critical acclaim.
