synopsis: "The play is set during the Ottoman-Venetian war for control of the island of Cyprus. Othello and Iago are the two main characters in the play. Othello is a military commander of Moorish race and a former general in the Venetian army. He has recently married the beautiful and rich Desdemona, against his father's wishes. Iago is Othello's malevolent ensign, but he was an evil man who deliberately angered his master, causing the usually Stoic Moor to kill his beloved wife.

act-brief: |
  _**Act I**_  
  Roderigo complains that his ensign friend Iago has not told him about the secret marriage between Desdemona and Othello. He is very unhappy because he is deeply in love with Desdemona and proposes marriage to her father, Brabantio.  
  Because Othello has promoted a man named Cassio, Iago doesn't think this soldier is like him and he hates Othello. He tells Roderigo that he plans to use Othello for his own benefit. Iago colluded with Roderigo to leak the news that Othello was eloping with Desdemona.  
  Brabantio is angered by Roderigo, and when he goes with Othello to the Duke's residence, he accuses Othello of seducing Desdemona with witchcraft. Othello defends himself before many senators, who are not satisfied until Desdemona confirms that she loves Othello. At the duke's command, Othello left Venice to lead the Venetian army against the Turks.  

  _**Act II**_  
  Act II-Upon arriving in Cyprus, they found the Turkish fleet destroyed, apparently by a storm. To celebrate this event, Othello ordered a celebration, and then hurried away to finish his engagement with Desdemona. Iago wants Cassio to join the fight, so he hires Roderigo as a lobbyist. A drunk Cassio even angrily attacked and injured Montano when he tried to calm him down. Othello appears at the right time and asks the whole story. Not surprisingly, Cassio received a rebuke from Othello and was stripped of his rank. So Iago's idea was successful, and Cassio was finally persuaded to make his own demand, that he be restored to military service through Desdemona's husband.  

  _**Act III**_  
  Iago tries to get Othello to trust Cassio and Desdemona less. Later, Desdemona's discarded handkerchief (Othello's first gift to her) was found by Emilia, who did not know what Iago wanted to use the handkerchief for, but at Iago's request, the handkerchief ended up in Iago's hands. Then, Iago took the opportunity to stir things up in Othello's ear, fabricating how his wife betrayed him, successfully provoking Othello's firm determination to kill Desdemona and Cassio, and promoting Iago to lieutenant. The III act is an important turning point, and Othello's tragic ending is to pay for his own belief in Iago's lies and full of doubts about Casio and Desdemona.  

  _**Act IV**_  
  Iago wants Othello to observe Cassio's reaction, so he drops the handkerchief at Cassio's house, while Iago confronts Cassio. Iago deliberately gores Cassio into talking about his affair with Bianca in order to convince Othello that they are talking about Desdemona, but he whispers her name. Later, When Othello sees Bianca accusing Cassio of giving her a second hand gift from another lover, Iago convinces him that cassio received desdemona's handkerchief.  
  Othello then decides to kill Desdemona and orders Iago to kill Cassio. Meanwhile, Roderigo complains that Iago didn't help him get the money and Desdemona, but Iago convinces him to kill Cassio.  

  _**Act V**_  
  Roderigo followed Iago's instructions and attacked Cassio in the street while he was heading home from Bianca's house. Roderigo was wounded, and Iago, blinded by the darkness, wounded Cassio in the leg. When Cassio's cry for help brings Lodovico and Gratiano, Iago, pretending nothing has happened, joins them. Later, Cassio recognized Roderigo as the one who hurt him. Iago stabbed Roderigo to prevent the incident from being revealed, and then blamed Bianca, claiming that it was Bianca's conspiracy.    
  Othello asked Desdemona for an explanation, but failed to suffocate Desdemona with a pillow. Emilia saw that Desdemona was still speaking for her husband before she died. However, Othello's mind was completely occupied by the idea of Desdemona's infidelity, and he could not listen to other explanations. Emilia wanted someone to solve the dilemma.   Former governor Montano was there with Graciano and Iago. When Othello mentions the handkerchief, Emilia finally realizes her husband's plot and tells the truth. Iago kills Emilia in a rage. A repentant Othello realizes that he has wronged Desdemona and that Iago is the real villain, so he stings Iago with his weapon, but does not take his life, leaving him to spend the rest of his life in penance is a more cruel punishment.   
  Iago chose to remain silent, and why he did so was unknown to anyone but himself. Lodovico eventually arrests Iago for murder, and Othello takes his own life. Cassio became the winner, succeeding Othello. Lodovico leaves after denouncing Iago and admonishing Cassio to do justice, and after leaving tells the others what happened.
